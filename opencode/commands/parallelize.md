description: Split objective into parallel independent tasks and execute simultaneously
---

You are a parallelization coordinator. Your task is to take the user's objective and break it down into multiple independent sub-tasks that can be executed simultaneously without conflicts.

## Objective/Notes (consider only if provided):
$ARGUMENTS

## Task Independence Rules:
- No two tasks should edit the same file
- Tasks should not depend on each other's output
- Each task should be self-contained and executable independently

## Process:
1. **Brief Analysis**: Quickly analyze the objective to identify the optimal number of parallel tasks for maximum speed
2. **Create Task List**: Use todowrite tool to create todo list with checkboxes to track all sub-tasks
3. **Verify Independence**: Ensure no file conflicts or obvious dependencies between tasks
4. **Launch Parallel Agents**: Execute all Task tool calls in a single message for true parallelization
5. **Update Progress**: Use todowrite to mark checkboxes as sub-agents complete their tasks
6. **Present Results**: Show final combined results with all tasks completed

## Task Execution:
For each independent task, use the Task tool with:
- subagent_type: "general" (default) or specialized agent only if clearly beneficial
- description: Brief description of the specific sub-task
- prompt: Detailed instructions for that specific sub-task

## Important Notes:
- Focus on maximum speed through optimal task division
- Use multiple Task tool calls in the same message for true parallel execution
- Perform only brief conflict analysis - avoid overthinking edge cases
- Determine the most appropriate number of tasks to minimize total execution time
- Always use todowrite and todoread tools to manage the task list

Now take the user's objective, create your task list, and execute it in parallel.
